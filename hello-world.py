def PrintHelloWorld():
	print("Hello World!")

#we almost always have a 'main' function, which calls other functions 
#and performs all tasks of our program
def main():
	PrintHelloWorld()

#telling the computer that the main function, 'def main', is the first thing you start with
if __name__=='__main__':
	main()

# __name__ == __main__ ??
	# 

# how to run
	# change directory (cd) where terminal is pulling from (i.e. desktop)
	#  then you can run the program since it's saved there
